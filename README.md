### 5. 🤖 AI Accountant (Insights Page)
Get deep analysis of your financial behavior from our multi-agent AI system.

**How it works:**
Each aspect of your finances is analyzed by a specialized AI agent:

| Agent | Role | What It Analyzes |
|-------|------|------------------|
| 💳 Payment Agent | Conservative Evaluator | Bill payment history, reliability |
| 🏦 Savings Agent | Long-term Planner | Emergency fund, savings rate |
| 💼 Income Agent | Risk Assessor | Income stability, gig economy gaps |
| 📊 Spending Agent | Behavioral Economist | Spending patterns, impulse control |
| 📈 Investment Agent | Wealth Builder | Portfolio diversity, risk tolerance |
| 🎯 Risk Agent | Sentiment Analyst | Overall financial risk profile |

These agents "discuss" your profile and reach a **consensus** on your score.

---

### 6. 🛂 Trust Passport
A shareable, privacy-preserving document that proves your financial trustworthiness to landlords, employers, or lenders — without exposing your raw bank data.

#### 🎯 The Problem It Solves
When students need to rent an apartment, lease a car, or apply for a credit card, they face a catch-22: **"You need credit history to get credit, but you can't get credit without credit history."**

Trust Passport creates a **digital letter of recommendation** for your finances.

#### ✅ What Verifiers SEE
| Information | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Trust Score | 84/100 |
| AI Council Consensus | 85% agreement |
| Confidence Level | High |
| Risk Tier | Low Risk |
| Behavioral Indicators | "Payment reliability positive", "Savings behavior stable" |

#### 🔒 What Stays HIDDEN (Privacy-Preserved)
| Hidden Information |
|-------------------|
| ❌ Bank account balances |
| ❌ Transaction details |
| ❌ Exact income amounts |
| ❌ Personal financial data |
| ❌ Account numbers |

#### 🔄 How It Works
1. **User clicks "Generate Trust Passport"**
2. **The system creates a unique shareable URL** like:
   ```
   https://credence.app/verify/yash-1738...
   ```
3. **User shares this link** with a landlord, employer, or lender
4. **The verifier opens the link** and sees your verified trust profile

#### 🏠 Real-World Example
> *"Hey, I'm a student with no credit history. Instead of a co-signer, here's my Credence Trust Passport showing my 84/100 Trust Score verified by 6 AI agents. It proves I pay bills on time and have stable savings patterns."*

The landlord clicks the link, sees the verified passport, and can make a decision based on **behavioral reliability** rather than just a credit score.

#### 🔑 Key Differentiator
Traditional credit reports share your entire financial history. Credence Passport shares only **behavioral signals** — proving you're reliable without exposing how much money you have.

**It's like proving you're a safe driver without showing your car's GPS history.**

---

### 7. 🔮 Future Simulator
Play "what-if" scenarios with your finances!

**Examples:**
- "What if I increase my savings by $200/month?"
- "What if I miss a payment?"
- "What if I get a summer internship?"

Watch your Trust Score change in real-time as you adjust sliders.

---

### 8. 🌙 Dark Mode
A beautiful, eye-friendly dark theme that works across the entire app. Toggle it with one click in the sidebar.

## 👥 Demo Personas

To showcase different financial situations, Credence includes three demo profiles:

| Persona | Description | Scenario |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| 🎓 Scholarship Student | Low debt, good savings | Best-case student scenario |
| 💸 Student w/ Loans | High debt, working to pay down | Common reality for many students |
| ⭐ Graduated Alumni | Post-grad, aggressive loan payoff | Life after graduation |

Switch between personas in the sidebar to see how the app adapts.

## 🏆 Built for SpartaHack 2025

This project was created for SpartaHack 2025 with the mission of **democratizing financial trust** for students and young people who are often excluded from traditional credit systems.

### The Problem
- 45 million Americans have no credit score
- Students can't get apartments, loans, or credit cards

- Income consistency
- Spending patterns
- Investment activity
